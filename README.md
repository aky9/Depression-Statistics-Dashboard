This repository contains an exploratory dashboard developed as part of a group project for STATS 507. Alongside my classmates, I worked on visualizing and analyzing depression statistics using various datasets. The dashboard provides insights into trends, demographic factors, and potential correlations related to depression. The project demonstrates our ability to work collaboratively, apply statistical methods, and present data in an accessible format.

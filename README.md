#  Depression Statistics Dashboard

This repository contains an exploratory dashboard developed as part of a group project for STATS 507. Alongside my classmates, I worked on visualizing and analyzing depression statistics using data from the CDC. The dashboard provides insights into trends, demographic factors, and potential correlations related to depression. It also has some modest machine learning tools (regressiion, ridge regression, catboost etc.) to predict rates of depression as well determining what factors are associated with it. To be clear, I am not and nor are my classmates medical professionals. Do not use this tool to make any health or medical decisions. This project was simply exploratory and a means to show off skills we had learned in the course.


# Key Features of the Dashboard:
* Data Visualization: Interactive graphs display the relationship between depression and health factors such as smoking, obesity, binge drinking, and more.
* Model Evaluation: Evaluate the performance of predictive models with metrics like MSE and RÂ².
* Feature Importance: Visual representations of which factors most significantly impact depression.
* Depression Rate Prediction: Customize predictions for future depression rates using filters for year, location, and demographic groups.

# How to Use This Dashboard:
Navigate through various sections using the menu options. Select different health factors from the dropdown menus to view their correlation with depression rates on the graphs. Use the control panels to adjust parameters and make predictions based on your interests and needs. We encourage you to explore the data, uncover insights, and consider how this information can be used to influence health policies and individual practices. 

# Conclusions
This dashboard serves as only a starting point for looking at the causes and trends of depression in the US. From our analysis we come to the following conclusions:

* Rates of depression are increasing.
* Depression has different frequencies depending upon the stratiication and state.
* Many social behaviors such as diet, tobacco use, and economic status offer predictive power for depression.
* Further work and data is needed to provide more accurate long term predictions and unravel the social factors that contribute to mental illness.

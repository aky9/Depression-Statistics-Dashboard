#  Depression Statistics Dashboard

This repository contains an exploratory dashboard developed as part of a group project for STATS 507. Alongside my classmates, I worked on visualizing and analyzing depression statistics using data from the CDC. The dashboard provides insights into trends, demographic factors, and potential correlations related to depression. It also has some modest machine learning tools to predict rates of depression as well determining what factors are associated with it. To be clear, I am not and nor are my classmates medical professionals. Do not use this tool to make any health or medical decisions. This project was simply exploratory and a means to show off skills we had learned in the course.


# Key Features of the Dashboard:
*Data Visualization: Interactive graphs display the relationship between depression and health factors such as smoking, obesity, binge drinking, and more.
*Model Evaluation: Evaluate the performance of predictive models with metrics like MSE and RÂ².
*Feature Importance: Visual representations of which factors most significantly impact depression.
*Depression Rate Prediction: Customize predictions for future depression rates using filters for year, location, and demographic groups.

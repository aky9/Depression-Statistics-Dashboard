#  Depression Statistics Dashboard

This repository contains an exploratory dashboard developed as part of a group project for STATS 507. Alongside my classmates, I worked on visualizing and analyzing depression statistics using data from the CDC. The dashboard provides insights into trends, demographic factors, and potential correlations related to depression. It also has some modest machine learning tools to predict rates of depression as well determining what factors are associated with it. To be clear, I am not and nor are my classmates medical professionals. Do not use this tool to make any health or medical decisions. This project was simply exploratory and a means to show off skills we had learned in the course.
